ðŸŒ¾ ## Agriculture Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting crop yields to improve agricultural productivity and support sustainable farming through data-driven insights. Agricultural output depends on complex factors such as climatic conditions, soil type, and crop characteristics, making accurate prediction a significant challenge.

Using the Agriculture Crop Yield dataset from Kaggle (1,000,000 samples), the study analyzed features like rainfall, temperature, fertilizer use, irrigation, and soil properties. A filtered subset called crop_yield_north_only was also used for regional testing and model validation.

Several machine learning algorithms were implemented â€” including Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€” to evaluate model performance in estimating yield (tons per hectare). Among these, Linear Regression achieved the highest accuracy (RÂ² = 0.904984), proving most effective for this dataset.

The project also compared preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and validation strategies. K-Fold cross-validation provided the most reliable generalization performance, minimizing overfitting compared to the Holdout approach.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data mining and predictive analytics can optimize agricultural planning, guide resource allocation, and contribute to sustainable and efficient crop management.
